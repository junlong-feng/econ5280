    "  * Containing constant 1 makes $\\mathbb{E}(\\varepsilon_{i})=0$ under $\\mathbb{E}(X_{i}\\varepsilon_{i})=0$.\n",
    "* $X$ is an $n\\times k$ matrix whose $i$-th row is $X_{i}'$. $Y$ and $\\varepsilon$ are $n\\times 1$ vectors.\n",
    "* Lecture 5 tells us when $\\beta$ is ATE or CATE when $\\mathbb{E}(X_{i}\\varepsilon_{i})=0$ holds (and possibly under some other assumptions).\n",
    "* Identification of $\\beta$ holds when $\\mathbb{E}(X_{i}X_{i}')\\neq 0$.\n",
    "* In this section, we forget about the meaning of $\\beta$ and only study how to estimate it when it is identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An MM Estimator**. We have shown in Lecture 5 that $\\beta=[\\mathbb{E}(X_{i}X_{i}')]^{-1}\\mathbb{E}(X_{i}Y_{i})$ under $\\mathbb{E}(X_{i}\\varepsilon_{i})=0$ and under the identification condition $\\mathbb{E}(X_{i}X_{i}')$ being full rank. However, these expectations are population quantities which we don't know how to calculate without knowing $(X_{i},Y_{i})$'s joint distribution.\n",

    "* This derivation of $\\hat{\\beta}$ is from the angle of an MM estimator; that is, constructing moment conditions first ($\\mathbb{E}[X_{i}(Y_{i}-X_{i}'\\beta)]=0$, solve for $\\beta$, and substitute all expectations with sample averages.\n",
    "* This estimator has another name: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), motivated from a different prospective (independently developed by Legendre and Gauss 200 years ago), widely adopted in traditional econometric texts. We did not derive OLS in that way since it's not general enough to nest other estimators we'll learn in this semester. \n",
    "* Note the model is linear in $\\beta$ but not necessarily linear in components in $X$. For instance, the estimator can handle anything like $Y_{i}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}D_{i}+\\beta_{2}D_{i}^{2}+\\beta^{3}\\log D_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i}$."

Wald test is so general that you can use it to test almost all kinds of equality nulls, no matter whether $r$ is one-dimensional or multidimensional, and no matter whether the functions in $r$ are linear or nonlinear. It also nests t-test: Since t-test the case where $q=1$, the square of one standard normal is a $\\chi_{1}^{2}$ distribution, you can verify that the square of the t statistic is equal to the Wald statistic in that case, and the critical value of Wald is exactly equal to the square of critical value of the t test."

    "  - Not significant because $2/1.5<1.64<1.96$. \n",

    "  - These hint $\\mathbb{E}(X_{i}X_{i}')$ is close to 0 ($X_{i}=(1,D_{i},W_{i})'$).\n",
    "  - Further you do Wald with $\\mathbb{H}_{0}:\\beta_{D}=\\beta_{W}=0$. You find the result is indeed significant.\n",
    "  - Finally regress $Y$ onto $D$ only and obtain  $\\hat{Y}=1.2+1.4D$ with $se(\\hat{\\beta}_{D})=0.7$.\n",
    "  - This time it's significant. 1.4 can be more biased than 2 because $W$ is omitted into the error but we know $W$ is correlated with $D$. However, the bias is downward towards 0, and you get a significant result for this smaller estimate, then you can argue that 2, closer to the truth, should also be significantly different from 0.\n",
    "  - This argument is **NOT** rigorous and can be totally wrong! For instance, how can you be sure that 2 is closer to the truth? What if it's inconsistent as well because $W$ is correlated with the error as we discussed in Section 4.1. However, as long as you're careful in this analysis and provide enough evidence supporting your argument, sometimes readers buy your story. This is the art side of applied econometrics.\n",

    "- If the variable of interest, or key variable, or treatment, $D$, comes from a random trial/experiment, say a lottery, and is dummy, write down a linear model and run OLS **if you want to learn ATE** only.\n",
    "  - Usually you run two versions: $Y$ on $D$ alone, and $Y$ on $D$ and controls $W$.\n",
    "  - Controls are included NOT for consistency; $D$ is already independent of everything else. \n",
    "  - The purpose of adding controls is to i) show robustness (i.e., estimates do not change across the two versions so $D$ is indeed independent of everything else) and ii) to reduce standard errors (the error is less noisy so $\\Sigma$ becomes smaller (in matrix sense)).\n",
    "  - Estimate of the coefficient of $D$ is consistent even if $W$ is correlated with the error because $D$ is independent of $W$.\n",
    "  - CATE usually cannot be consistently estimated in this way because linear model is usually wrong when we think about CATE. See Lecture 5.\n",
    "- In all other cases, writing down a linear model is already an assumption and including controls can or cannot resolve the issue of omitted variable bias. The best you can do if you do want to use OLS is the following: By carefully comparing differences across specifications, you come up with a logical story to convince your readers. See the earlier real data example.\n",
    "  - We will learn modern approaches (e.g. machine learning) which resolve these problems in Lecture 8.\n",
    "- When you have an insignicant estimate, don't panic. \n",
    "  - Significance is no longer the first order priorty in today's econ research. Top journals discourage researchers to report stars and $p$-values.\n",
    "  - Sample size is the most important factor for (in)significance. So if your result is not significant, blame your sample size first.\n",
    "    - Instead of saying it's not significant, say \"my data set is not rich enough to obtain a precise estimate of the effect\".\n",
    "  - When your sample size is reasonable, insignificance may be a result of imperfect multicollinearity. You may consider to do the procedures in Section 4.2.\n",
    "- To sum up, OLS works under strong assumptions $\\mathbb{E}(X_{i}\\varepsilon_{i})=0$ (and linearity). This is the last method you want to use unless you really have experimental data, your $D$ is non-continuous, and you only care about ATE."
