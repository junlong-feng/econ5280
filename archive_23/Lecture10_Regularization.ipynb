    "* Motivation: To introduce a powerful idea when handling high-dimensional data and how to use it for causal inference.\n",

    "## 1. High-dimensional (IV) Regression \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a linear regression model:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y=X\\beta+\\varepsilon,\\mathbb{E}(X_{i}\\varepsilon_{i})=0\\ \\forall i.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We learned that we can estimate $\\beta$ by $\\hat{\\beta}=(X'X)^{-1}(X'Y)$. Suppose $X$ is $n\\times p$, then $X'X$ is $p\\times p$; this matrix is invertible only if $X$ has rank $p$ (asymptotically). Matrix algebra tells us that $rank(X)=\\min\\{n,p\\}$, so at least we need $n\\geq p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some datasets in this big data era where $p$ is much larger than $n$. Theoretically, we can model it as \"$p\\to\\infty$ with $n\\to\\infty$ and $p/n\\to\\text{a constant or }\\infty$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some online shopping website's customer data: $n$ is the number of registered user. $p$ is the number of variables about customer behavior that the website can track; browsing history, time spent on each page, etc. $p$ can be potentially very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we do have $p>n$, OLS, and in fact every method we have learned so far will no longer work because your data matrix $X$ is no longer intervible.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to solve this problem is to use **regularization**, or **penalty**. Below is a specific penalty called LASSO (**least absolute shrinkage and selection operator*):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\beta}^{LASSO}=\\arg\\min_{b}(Y-Xb)'(Y-Xb)+\\lambda\\sum_{j=1}^{p}|b_{j}|.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The first term on the right hand side is the objective function of OLS. The second is new. It's called a penalty. $\\lambda$ is a positive constant set by you. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What's the effect of the LASSO penalty?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how LASSO works, consider a simple case where $p=1$. If the minimizer $\\hat{\\beta}^{LASSO}$ turns out to be positive, then by by $|\\hat{\\beta}^{LASSO}|=\\hat{\\beta}^{LASSO}$, we have\n",
    "$$\n",
    "-2X'(Y-X\\hat{\\beta}^{LASSO})+\\lambda=0\\implies X'X\\hat{\\beta}^{LASSO}=X'Y-\\lambda/2\\implies \\hat{\\beta}^{LASSO}=\\hat{\\beta}^{OLS}-\\frac{\\lambda}{2}(X'X)^{-1}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Similarly, if $\\hat{\\beta}^{LASSO}<0$, then we would have $\\hat{\\beta}^{LASSO}=\\hat{\\beta}^{OLS}+\\frac{\\lambda}{2}(X'X)^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $|\\hat{\\beta}^{LASSO}|$ is always strictly smaller than $\\hat{\\beta}^{OLS}$. Specifically,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\beta}^{LASSO}=\\begin{cases}\\max\\{\\hat{\\beta}^{OLS}-\\frac{\\lambda}{2}(X'X)^{-1},0\\}&\\text{if } \\hat{\\beta}^{OLS}>0;\\\\\\min\\{\\hat{\\beta}^{OLS}+\\frac{\\lambda}{2}(X'X)^{-1},0\\}&\\text{if } \\hat{\\beta}^{OLS}<0.\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is why LASSO is called a shrinkage estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When does LASSO work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "LASSO works when we assume that although $p>>n$, the number of the **true** $\\beta_{j}$s that are **not equal to 0** is **much smaller than $n$**. This assumption is called **sparsity**. Under sparsity, LASSO works because it sets a subset of $\\hat{\\beta}$ exactly equal to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias-variance tradeoff and bias-correction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the $p=1$ case above, $\\hat{\\beta}^{OLS}$ is unbiased by OLS theory. Then obviously LASSO introduces bias since $\\lambda>0$. Its variance is usually smaller because the estimator is more concentrated around 0. A popular way to debias the estimator is to run another round of OLS only using the variables that are selected by LASSO. This procedure is called **post-LASSO**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation details**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since LASSO sets relatively small coefficients to 0, the coefficients for different regressors need to be comparable. Hence, one always need to standarize regressors first: demean and divide the $X$s with standard deviation so that the unit of $X$ does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lambda$ can be chosen by, say, cross-validation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose $E(\\varepsilon_{i}(D_{i},W_{i}')')=0$. We cannot estimate $\\beta$ by OLS if $W$ is high-dimensional. It's also not good to directly run LASSO because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we include $\\beta$ in the penalty, $D$ may be dropped if $\\beta$ is small in magnitude. \n",
    "- If we do not include $\\beta$ in LASSO, $D$ is protected but if we make a mistake by dropping $W$ that may cause OVB, we again get biased estimate.\n",

    "5. Run 2SLS by treating $\\hat{u}_{YX}$ as the dependent variable, $\\tilde{D}$ as the endogenous variable and $\\tilde{Z}$ as the IV.\n",

    "So far, we only studied cross-sectional data: we observe multiple units for one time period. However, it's natural to have multiple time periods in a data set. If our data contain both multiple time periods and multiple units, we say we have a panel data set.\n",

The so-called fundamental problem of causal inference is that $Y_{it}$ is either equal to $Y_{it}(1)$ or $Y_{it}(0)$ depending on $D_{it}$, but since $D_{it}$ only has one realization, we cannot simultaneously observe both. \n",

    "The $Y(0)$ matrix is formed by the same set of individuals. Their outcome overtime should have certain dependence. If the dependence is linear, the rank of the matrix would be low compared to $N$ and $T$.\n",

This method has a wide application: extracting humans/background from surveillance video, removing shadows from face images, etc. The idea is very similar to LASSO: \n",

    "- The rank of a matrix is **equal to** the number of nonzero eigenvalues.\n",
    "- A symmetric matrix has low-rank when a lot of eigenvalues are zero.\n",
    "- So the vector of the eigenvalues is sparse for a low-rank matrix. \n",
    "- For a general matrix, a similar notion is called singular values.\n",
    "- Therefore, if we impose the LASSO penalty on the singular values, we would presumably obtain a low-rank estimator, which approximates the true matrix well if the latter is low-rank.\n",
    "- Recall LASSO penalty is the sum of absolute values. \n",
    "- The sum of absolute value of singular values of a matrix $M$ is called the **nuclear norm** of the matrix, denoted by $\\|M\\|_{*}$. \n",
    "- Therefore, the LASSO penalty is equal to the nuclear norm.\n",
