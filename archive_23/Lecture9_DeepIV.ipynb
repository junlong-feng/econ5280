    "\n",
    "From Lecture 7, no matter what the true function $Y=g(D,W,U)$ is, we have the following results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When $D$ and $Z$ are both binary and no other covariates are present, a linear model captures LATE. 2SLS/IV/GMM gives you consistent estimates of LATE.\n",
    "- When $D$ and $Z$ are binary with covariates, CLATE is identified by some ratio of conditional expectation differences. Can be estimated consistently by causal forest.\n",
    "  - $CLATE(W)=[\\mathbb{E}(Y|Z=1,W)-\\mathbb{E}(Y|Z=0,W)]/[\\mathbb{E}(D|Z=1,W)-\\mathbb{E}(D|Z=0,W)]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When $D$ and $Z$ are more complicated, discrete or continuous, identification of CLATE/LATE is much involved and is still an active research area.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we make assumptions on $g$, the function that determines $Y$, to handle more complicated $D$ and $Z$ instead of identifying/estimating causal effect without any structure when $D$ and $Z$ are both binary. However, these assumptions are much weaker than a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that $Y=g(D,W,U)$ in general where $g$ is an unknown function and $U$ is a vector of unobservable. We assume in this lecture that this function has an **additively separable form** such that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g(D,W,U)=m(D,W)+U,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and $U$ is a **scalar**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This form is more flexible than linear models since it nests the latter: A linear model is to further assume $m(D,W)=\\beta_{0}+D\\beta+W'\\beta_{W}$.\n",
    "- This model is less flexible than the orginal one because i) $U$ is **additively separable** and ii) $U$ is a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $D$ is endogenous in the sense that $cov(W,U)\\neq 0$, but suppose we have an instrument $Z$ such that $\\mathbb{E}(U|Z,W)=\\mathbb{E}(U|W)$. Then we call this model a **nonparametric instrumental variable model** (NPIV, Newey and Powell, 2003, *Econometrica*).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Identification of the NPIV Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have assumed $m$ is the true function that determines $Y$, as long as we know $m$, we know everything and thus all kinds of causal effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "To know $m$, we need to construct moment conditions:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}(Y|W,Z)=&\\mathbb{E}(m(D,W)|W,Z)+\\mathbb{E}(U|W,Z)\\\\\n",
    "=&\\mathbb{E}(m(D,W)|W,Z)+\\mathbb{E}(U|W)\\\\\n",
    "=&\\int_{d} [m(d,W)+\\mathbb{E}(U|W)]dF_{D|WZ}(d|W,Z).\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $F_{D|WZ}(d|W,Z)$ is the conditional density of $D$: $f_{D|WZ}(d|W,Z)$ if $D$ is absolutely continuous, and is the probability function $\\Pr(D=d|W,Z)$ if $D$ is discrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above gives us a moment equation for $m(d,W)+\\mathbb{E}(U|W)$ as everything else involved is identifiable moments from the population. If this gives us a unique solution, we say $m(d,W)+\\mathbb{E}(U|W)$ is **identified**. Although $m$ itself is not identified, this is sufficient to give us any causal effect because $\\mathbb{E}(U|W)$ is cancelled out:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Effect of $D$ on $Y$ from $d'$ to $d$}: m(d,W)-m(d',W)=m(d,W)+\\mathbb{E}(U|W)-(m(d',W)+\\mathbb{E}(U|W)).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**. Uniqueness of the solution to the moment equation relies on technical conditions that are beyond the scope of this course. Inverting an integral equation is subject to the so-called \"ill-posed problem\" in math. If the integral is simply summation of finite terms, then a full-rankness type condition can do. However, when it's an integral, the infinite-dimensional analogue of \"full-rankness\" is not enough. Let me know if you're interested in this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $h(D,W)=m(D,W)+\\mathbb{E}(U|W)$. The moment condition gives us an integral equation for $h(\\cdot,W)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When $D$ is discrete**, say $D=\\{1,2,\\ldots,J\\}$, the equations are like:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{d=1}^{J}h(d,W)\\Pr(D=d|W,Z)=\\mathbb{E}(Y|W,Z).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Then for every $W=w$ of interest, this equation has $J$ unknowns $(h(1,w),h(2,w),\\ldots,h(J,w))$. If $Z$ is continuous or discrete with at least $J$ values as well, we can have at least $J$ equations for different values of $Z$. Then all we need to do is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimate $\\Pr(D=d|W=w,Z=z)$ and $\\mathbb{E}(Y|W=w,Z=z)$ by, say, causal forest, for every $z$ and every $w$ of interest.\n",
    "- Then we invert the matrix of $\\hat{\\Pr}(D=d|W=w,Z=z)$ and obtain $\\hat{h}(d,w)$ for all $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When $D$ is continuous**, $Z$ also needs to be continuous and we have an integral equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_{s}h(s,W)f_{D|WZ}(s|W,Z)ds=\\mathbb{E}(Y|W,Z).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is not easy to do numerically; you can again estimate $f_{D|WZ}$ and $\\mathbb{E}(Y|W,Z)$, but now that $s$ can take on a continuum of numbers, there are infinite unknowns to be solved for. Extremely challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Newey and Powell (2003) proposed a method based on traditional nonparametrics. In this lecture, we introduce a new one based on ML: **Deep IV** by Hartford, Lewis, Leyton-Brown, and Taddy (2017, \"Deep IV: a flexible approach for Counterfactual prediction\", *Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning*).\n",

    "Neural netwoks are (one of, modestly) the most popular building block of deep learning. They have many uses, but today we focus on function approximation: We are going to build neural networks to approximate an arbitrary function, $h$ and $f_{D|WZ}$.\n",

    "- Widely used in 80s and early 90s. Less popular in late 90s.\n",
    "- Today: State-of-art technique for many applications.\n",

    "Example 1. Suppose we have a real vector $x=(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})$ and a real valued function of it $h(x)$. We observe the function value $y$, but don't know $h$ is. We want to use a flexible enough **parametric** function $h_{\\theta}(x)$ to approximate the unknown $h$. A neural net is such an approximation: (See the graph on Canvas)\n",

    "  - Then from the hidden layer to the final outcome, we again linear combine $a^{(2)}$s first by some $\\theta^{(2)}$s, and then pass into the second activation function $f^{(2)}$. That is our final $h_{\\theta}(x)$:\n",

    "- Asymptotic inference is still unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Applications and Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, Deep IV can be applied to any scenarios when you do not want to make too many assumptions on the functional form of the relationship between $Y$ and $(D,W)$. However, given its drawbacks, you can consider alternative methods as well when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Its best applicaltion scenario is when your $D$ and $Z$ are continuous and you have a lot of covariates in $Z$ and/or $W$, especially some of them are not traditional numerical variables. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Sponsored advertisements paid to search engine generate over 40 billion U.S. dollars annually for search engines (Goldman and Rao, 2014, \"Experiment as instruments: Heterogeneousgeneous position effects in sponsered search auctions\", *EAI Endorsed Transactions on Serious Games*). Example: search anything, like health insurance in Google. There can be **Ad** showing up on the first a few results \n",
    "\n",
    "- They examine how advertiser's position on the Bing search page (called *slot*, our $D$) affects probability of a user click ($Y$).\n",
    "- $D$ is endogenous because it is correlated with latent user intent. For instance, when a user searches for \"Coke\", it is likely that both she will click and that \"Coke\" is the top-advertiser.\n",
    "- Instruments $Z$ contain a large number of indicators for experiments run by Bing in which advertiser-query pairs were randomly assigned to different algorithms that in turn scored advertisers differently in search auctions, resulting in random variation in position.\n",
    "- Covariates $W$ contain text data like user query.\n",
    "- $n>20$ million.\n",
    "- They find that, among other results, \"on-brand query\" (like Coke bids on the word \"Coke\"), position is worth more to small websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "For implementation, Hartford, Lewis, Leyton-Brown, and Taddy (2017) developed a Python package called DeepIV.\n",
